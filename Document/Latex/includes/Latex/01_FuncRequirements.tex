\section{Server Database}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Option to implement pseudo deletions and pseudo changes
	\item Pseudo Changes: Any changes to database make a "deleted" version of the row, and THEN change it, so you can see the changes later (until end of day).
	\item Pseudo Deletions: Any deletions to database aren't actually deleted until end of day. 
	\item Changes to fields
	\item Daily backups of the database are archived for x days back (daily backup done before daily deletions).
	\item SQL Changes are done local, then broadcast
	\item When client is idle, then synchronize received changes
	\item big changes need to roll between clients so the load is spread (1-$>$2; 1-$>$3, 2-$>$4; 1-$>$5, 2-$>$6, 3-$>$7, 4-$>$8, 5-$>$9)
	\item Backup mode for terminals (Just holds database and waits for a terminal to fail, when it will ask what terminal it should replace.)
